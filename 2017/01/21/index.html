    <!-- HISTORICAL CONTEXT -->
    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
    <p>January 21, 2017 marked Trump's first full day as President and established several patterns that would define his presidency. His visit to CIA headquarters was intended to repair relationships with the intelligence community after months of tension during the transition, but his remarks focusing on crowd sizes and media criticism rather than national security drew widespread criticism. The day also saw the implementation of his first executive order targeting the Affordable Care Act, beginning the systematic rollback of Obama-era policies. The regulatory freeze and website changes signaled the administration's intent to quickly reverse the previous administration's agenda. The day coincided with Women's March protests in cities across the country, representing early organized opposition to the new presidency (TIME, NYT).</p>
